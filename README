These are the posterior distributions on the sum of the neutrino masses, as derived from measurements on neutrino oscillations.
They may be suitable as cosmological priors.

In each file the first column is an array of sigma = m1 + m2 + m3 (eV)
The second column holds the corresponding p(sigma) values

sigma_ih.dat: The posterior on sigma given the inverted hierarchy
sigma_nh.dat: The posterior on sigma given the normal hierarchy
sigma_wt.dat: The weighted average of the two hierarchies
